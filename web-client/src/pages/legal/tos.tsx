                        These Terms of Service (ToS) govern your use of the SpaceRead (formerly UAEU Space) website (referred to as &quot;the
                        website&quot;). By accessing and using the website, you agree to comply with these terms. If you
                        disagree
                        with any part of these terms, we kindly ask you to refrain from using the website.

                    <p>
                        SpaceRead is a platform designed to facilitate the sharing of course materials and provide a
                        platform for students at UAEU (United Arab Emirates University) to rate their professors. It aims to
                        create a collaborative environment where students can access study materials and benefit from the
                        experiences and insights of their peers.

                    <p>
                        The website is divided into two main sections: the study materials section and the rate a professor
                        section. In the study materials section, students can search for available courses, download
                        materials uploaded by other students, and contribute their own study materials. All uploaded
                        materials are subject to review by our moderation team to ensure their appropriateness and
                        relevance.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The rate a professor section allows students to rate and review their experiences with professors at
                        UAEU. Whether it&apos;s evaluating their educational performance, teaching style, or other aspects,
                        students can share their honest opinions to help fellow students make informed decisions.

                        website. However, it is important to note that the content shared by users prior to termination may
                        still remain accessible to other users.
